**AI-Powered Hunger Heatmap with QR-Based Relief Verification System**
Project Overview:
  This project aims to support United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 â€“ Zero Hunger by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain Technology.
It predicts hunger-prone zones using real-world data such as rainfall, crop failures, job losses, and food prices â€” and ensures fair food distribution through QR-based digital tokens.
The system is built as a Flask web application that generates a live Hunger Heatmap, manages food token distribution, verifies beneficiaries through QR code scanning, and records every transaction transparently.
